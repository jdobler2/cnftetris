To compile: make
To run: ./subgraphcount

From the resulting prompt, enter "loadcnf FILENAME [MODE]" (no quotes) to load the dataset into memory, then enter "tc fr" to begin. MODE should be filled in with 12 for without locks and 13 for with locks, with the additional suffixes "+" for Breadth First Search and "_" for Singleton. Note that singleton and locks enabled at the same time presently leads to undefined behavior.

The code can also be run from the command line as "./subgraphcount s -e [FILENAME] [MODE] [flags]", where "filename" can be either the name of a file or "stdin".

Please be advised that the code must be run on a computer with a CPU that supports SIMD 4.x and AVX2. If this is not the case, the code will ungracefully crash.

Flags include: -o [ordering], -q (quiet), -ratio (to specify an insertion ratio.

Flags can be determined from the prompt (i.e., not CLI) through "set [flag] [value]", where "flag" should be written out in full.
